                <h3><b><u>Global AI Conclave 2024:</u></b></h3>
                <p>An Enlightening Experience at the Global AI Conclave 2024<br>I am thrilled to share my experience from the Global AI Conclave 2024, hosted by CNBC in partnership with Moneycontrol, on 22nd November at the Conrad Ballroom, Halasuru.
                    The conclave brought together some of the brightest minds in the AI and technology space, and I had the privilege of attending insightful sessions and panel discussions led by industry stalwarts.<br>
                    <b>Key takeaways included:</b><br>
                     -> The transformative power of AI in governance, healthcare, and education.<br>
                     -> A fascinating showcase of the WildSense Project, aimed at wildlife safety through AI innovation.<br>
                     -> Learning about cutting-edge developments, like open-source Arabic language model Jais and AI-enabled medical advancements in breast cancer detection and brain mapping.<br>
                     -> Insights into how AI is being leveraged for traffic management and urban development.<br>
                     -> A special highlight was the discussion on AI in chess, where Grandmasters and AI experts delved into how technology is reshaping the game.</p>
