                <h3>NASSCOM:</h3>
                <p>The tech event "Future Through Tech Lens," organized by NASSCOM at Radisson Blu Hotel, was a dynamic exploration of emerging technologies shaping our future. As a volunteer, my experience was both enriching and insightful, providing a firsthand glimpse into the world of innovation and connectivity.<br>
                The event commenced with an air of excitement as industry leaders and technology enthusiasts converged to delve into the realms of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and IoT, envisioning their transformative impact.<br>
                As a volunteer, my responsibilities encompassed a diverse array of tasks, from facilitating registrations to guiding participants to their respective venues. We also got to meet and understand many startups like - PadCare, Fedo, Margo, Hivelink (which was a budding startup founded by the 4th year students of St Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore), Reprosci Biosciences. I also got the privilege of meeting Ms. Aasawari Kane, the visionary founder of PadCare and Ms. Anju Bobby George, a prominent figure in sports.
                The "Future Through Tech Lens" event was a combination of enlightenment and networking opportunities. Interacting with esteemed individuals like Ms. Kane and Ms. George underscored the profound impact of technology on diverse domains, including healthcare and sports. As a volunteer, the event not only broadened my understanding of technological advancements but also reinforced the importance of embracing innovation for a future rich with transformative possibilities. Not just that, this experience has taught me how to handle situations with a calm mind, be polite with everyone and treat everyone with utmost respect, always be ready to help other and lastly how to coordinate your task with others in your team and work efficiently. As a volunteer, the event also provided invaluable insights and networking opportunities that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavours both in my personal as well as professional life.</p>
