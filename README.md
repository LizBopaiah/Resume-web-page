# Resume-web-page
I created a personal resume webpage using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, education, and projects.
**Highlights of the Project:
- A clean and responsive design that works well on all devices.
- Easy navigation between sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- Professional yet creative layout to present my profile in an engaging way.
This project helped me improve my web development skills and better understand how to design user-friendly interfaces.
